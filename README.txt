Final project for my algorithms class. Competition of who could write a TSP algorithm that generated the shortest paths. Seven Different maps were used, of which my algorithm calculated the shortest path in three out of seven classes. 

To run:
1. Execute the command "ant", this will create the file Project4.jar in the current directory
2. Execute the command "java -jar Porject4.jar [test-input-X.txt]" where X is the input file you wish results for.
3. Output analysis from run will be saved in file test-input.txt.tour.txt.
